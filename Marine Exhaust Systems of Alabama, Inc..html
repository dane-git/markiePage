<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Given the original part or a detailed drawing We
can quote you a price on almost any part. We build from only the best materials.
For example, the inside liners in all of our risers are Inconel 625. Inconel
625 is normally used in aerospace manufacturing and cryogenic applications,
due to its strong resistance to sulfuric acid and corrosion. Inconel does
not rust or corrode in any way under any circumstance and it's ability
to withstand the formation of sulfuric acid. (When salt water combines
with exhaust, sulfuric acid forms and eats a riser from inside out, while
not damaging the outside jacket leaving the owner unaware of the internal
leakage). For the water jacket we use Stainless Steel 316L, the marine
industry standard.&nbsp; If you have any question regarding the material
we use or if you are interested in getting a quote, please give us a call."

<h2>
<a NAME="Shipping"></a>Shipping</h2>
We have used numerous shippers in the past and as a result we have some that we really like to use 
as we know that they will pick up when they say they will and that we can depend on them to pick up 
the same day we call. If you specify someone out of the ordinary or someone who does not make 
daily pick ups or someone we are not familiar with please be aware that your parts may take a 
extra day or so to ship as we await pick up.
<p>That being said, we have used a variety of companies such as
UPS, FedEX, DHL, Pilot, BAX-aka Schenker, Kamino, Stevens, Quick, Emery/Menlo,
US Mail, Saia, AAA Cooper, American/Fed Ex Freight, Estes, Central Freight, Central Transportation, 
Unishippers, Acme, Watkins, Gator (sorry but we do not and will not use R&amp;L), ABF, Con-Way, Overnite, Old Dominion, 
Averitt, Panalpina, Dockside Services, USF Holland, USF Dugan, Southeastern Freight, 
Service Transport, Wilson, Viking, JAS, Roadway, Reddaway (interlined) and Yellow that
I can think of off hand. If you have an account with someone please let us know. 
If you would like to ship via some other company, let us know and we will see what we can do. 
We are diligent in our efforts to receive the best discounts and service possible. 
When you specify Bestway, be assured your parts will be shipped the very best way possible.
<br>If you need your part hot shotted we have a couple companies we can use for that also.
<p>If your part is approx. 70# or less and not too ackward it can be shipped
via UPS. UPS picks up every day at 3:30 PM central standard. If we have your
part in stock, the order would need to be placed before 1:30 PM central
standard to ship it the day the order is placed. 
Below is a standard UPS ground transit time map from our location. 
The shipping department did not want me to put this map online, as it may not always be accurate. 
Please keep this in mind and refer to this only as a reference of the usual/best guess transit times
for UPS regular ground.
<br>
<a NAME="UPST"></a><img src="ups.jpg" BORDER=0 width=50% height=auto>
<p>
If you would like to use FedEx, we do not have a daily pick up so allow for an extra day just to get them over here to pick up plus it'll probabaly cost a little more.
Here are their regular-best guess-transit times
<br><img src="fedex map.jpg" BORDER=0 width=50% height=auto>

<br>
<p>If your part requires motor freight, 
it is more convenient for us to pick the trucking company. If you must use a specific truckline 
please be aware it may delay your shipment by one to two days as we schedule a pick up.
<p>All shipping freight collect FOB Fairhope, AL 36532. If you would like
shipping billed to a shipping company with whom you have terms, please
supply your account number and we will do our part to arrange third party billing.

<a NAME="Marinization Kits"></a>Marinization Kits</h2>
We are a Post Manufacturing Marinizer (PMM). Give us any engine and we can design a Keeled Cooled and Heat Exchanger
Cooled Kit including Water Cooled Manifold, Expansion Tank, Heat Exchanger,
Raw Water Pump, Fan Guard, Water Inlets, Water Outlets, Wet Exhaust Ell's,
Wet and Dry Exhaust Risers, and etc... The design is then priced and you
are quoted the prototyping cost as well as the purchase cost.
<p>If all cost are covered, you retain propriety over the design, i.e.
when someone wants to buy the kit they can only buy it through you, and
in turn you would purchase the kit through us at the initial quoted price.
We have marinized engines for various companies, individuals, independent
small businesses, and not mention propriety marinization kits and parts
for the original engine manufacturers including Caterpillar, Cummins, Isotta
Fraschini, Hercules, and Daewoo.
<p>We recently designed Marinization Kits for the International 530E/Series 40, John Deere 6081,
Hercules LDT 465, Daewoo DC24, DB33 and DB58, Ford BSD 666T, the Detroit Series 60 11.1. 
We are currently in the process of obtaining a Perkins 6.354.4 range four engine in house in order to redesign the marinization kit. 
We have completed numerous kits in the past, if interested in marinizing an engine please give Mark
a call. 
<br>"We will need an engine for approximately two months."

We duplicate parts daily. If you have an outdated part, a part that is
no longer cast, or a part that could be manufactured both faster and cheaper,
please send the part to us and we will quote you a price. We recently redesigned
the water cooled manifold on the Detroit 8.2.

Our work is top quality and our prices are more than competitive. We believe

welders and welding practices, that there is no limit to what we can accomplish
and no limit to the quality and durability of anything we manufacture.

<a NAME="Testing and Repair"></a>Testing and Repair</h2>
If you have a part that is suspect or has a known failure, send it in and
we will quote you the expected repair cost once we find the failure. The
most common failures to date are pinhole leaks in porous cast manifolds
and leaking heat exchanger tubes. Both of these problems are usually easily
repairable.&nbsp; Major repairs on cast are not that common, which is good,
because these repairs are risky, a good chance that the cast piece will
crack, but we don't mind trying. During the repair process, we will keep
you up to date on all testing and other occurrences so that you will be
well informed. We will also get your approval for all work before we start,
we will estimate the cost of each stage as close as possible to eliminate
any surprises. We will try to save you money and time throughout.

<br>I spend alot of time on this so let me know what you think, good or bad. Really! 
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

  
<br><br><br><!--<br>Also, if you are already a customer, please let me know how you feel you were treated and how you liked the whole "Marine Exhaust Experience".
<br>I plan on putting a comment page together to list the good and the bad, without edit (I may censor language, a little...)
<br>I/We take great pride in being a customer driven company and jump at the chance to improve, where ever possible.
<br><br>
<!--<br>Please give me your honest opinion, as blunt and brash as you like. I'm thick skinned and I really, truly want to know. 
<br>Your evaluation will be so very helpful. Please e-mail it to <a href="mailto:Markyall@comcast.net">Markyall@comcast.net</a>
